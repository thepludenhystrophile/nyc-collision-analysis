# NYC Motor Vehicle Collision Analysis – Power BI

## Project Overview

This project analyzes motor vehicle collisions reported by the New York City Police Department (NYPD) from January to August 2020. I used Power BI to explore when and where collisions happen, the top contributing factors, and who is most affected across boroughs and vehicle types.

## Executive Summary

The analysis revealed a sharp early-year spike in collisions (March = 10.5%), a Friday rush-hour peak (3–6 PM), and a surge in late-night crashes on weekends (12–4 AM). Belt Parkway recorded the highest number of collisions (3,728; 1.56%). While "Unspecified" was the most common cause overall due to missing data, Driver Inattention/Distraction was the top known contributor to crashes. For fatal collisions, Unsafe Speed was the most deadly recorded factor. Brooklyn had the highest number of collisions overall, and pedestrians were the most affected group.

## 📊 Key Insights

1. **Monthly Trends**  
   March had the highest share of collisions (10.5%), followed by January and February. Collision rates declined steadily toward December (7.1%).

2. **Time of Day & Week**  
   Collisions peaked on Fridays between 3–6 PM. Weekends showed more crashes in the early hours (12–4 AM), often tied to distraction and unsafe behavior.

3. **Most Impacted Street**  
   Belt Parkway recorded the most collisions (3,728), accounting for 1.56% of all crashes in this period.

4. **Leading Causes**  
   “Unspecified” was the top listed factor due to incomplete reporting. Among known causes, Driver Inattention/Distraction ranked highest.

5. **Fatal Crash Factors**  
   Unsafe Speed was the most common recorded factor in fatal collisions after “Unspecified.”

6. **Borough & Road User Impact**  
   Brooklyn recorded the highest number of collisions. Pedestrians were most affected in terms of fatalities, followed by motorists.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Power BI Desktop** – for designing dashboards and visuals  
- **Power Query** – for cleaning and transforming raw data  
- **DAX** – for calculated measures and insights  
- **Power BI Visuals** – bar charts, donut charts, line graphs, matrix tables, slicers, and cards

## Recommendations
- Run awareness campaigns on distracted driving and safe weekend driving  
- Reinforce speed limits on high-risk roads like Belt Parkway  
- Prioritize pedestrian safety infrastructure in high-density boroughs
